## Election-Audit Summary:

The software code employed in this election audit can be used in any other election across the United States, as long as the results of any election can be tabulated in this same CSV format, with each row containing: (1) Ballot ID, (2) County where cast, and (3) the candidate for whom the vote was cast.

This code is very efficient in quickly analyzing the results of any election given this format. The number of candidates or the number of counties where the election takes place does not matter, as this code can handle any number of these and provide the same quality result. Thus, this code can easily be modified to handle any number of candidates and any number of counties. As a second and more comprehensive example of its flexibility, the code can be modified to handle a national level election with many counties and many candidates.
